# vite-project - Very rough try
Rough move over from vanilla js to React. Copying over same basic structure. 
To setup, run npm run dev in .
Open another terminal and run in ./src/assets
json-server --watch testQuestions.json 

I have many questions about react, but this is my first try, so trying to get some practice. 
For sure will need code reviews
